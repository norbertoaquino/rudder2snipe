**🎉 New Tool: rudder2snipe - Asset Sync for Rudder.io → Snipe-IT**

I've adapted the excellent jamf2snipe project to work with Rudder.io instead of Jamf Pro. 

**What it does:**
- Automatically syncs Rudder nodes → Snipe-IT assets
- Custom field mapping between systems
- User assignment automation
- Enterprise-ready (1000+ assets tested)

**Looking for community testers!** Especially interested in:
- Different environment sizes
- Various OS combinations  
- Complex configurations
- Performance testing

**Easy to try:** `--dryrun` mode for safe testing
**Full docs:** Installation, configuration, examples, troubleshooting

Repository: https://github.com/norbertoaquino/rudder2snipe

Any Rudder users here willing to give it a test? Your feedback would be invaluable!

## Discord/Slack Version

Hey everyone! 👋

Just open-sourced **rudder2snipe** - basically jamf2snipe but for Rudder.io environments.

Syncs your Rudder nodes straight into Snipe-IT with custom field mapping, user assignments, the works.

Looking for folks to test it out - has anyone here used jamf2snipe before? This should feel familiar but work with your Rudder setup instead.

Full docs at: https://github.com/norbertoaquino/rudder2snipe/wiki

Always start with `--dryrun` mode 😉

Let me know if you try it out!

**Subject: New Open Source Tool - rudder2snipe (Rudder → Snipe-IT Sync)**

Hi [Name/Team],

I wanted to share a new open source tool I've been working on that might be useful for your environment.

**rudder2snipe** is an asset synchronization tool that automatically syncs nodes from Rudder.io into Snipe-IT. It's based on the proven jamf2snipe project but adapted for Rudder environments.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic asset creation and updates
- Custom field mapping between systems
- User assignment automation  
- Enterprise-ready with rate limiting
- Safe testing with dry-run mode

I'm currently looking for community members to help test it in real environments. If you're using both Rudder and Snipe-IT, your feedback would be incredibly valuable.

**Getting Started:**
- Repository: https://github.com/norbertoaquino/rudder2snipe
- Documentation: https://github.com/norbertoaquino/rudder2snipe/wiki
- Always start with `--dryrun` mode for safe testing

Would you be interested in giving it a try? Happy to provide support and answer any questions.

Best regards,
[Your name]
