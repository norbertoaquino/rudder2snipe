# 🚀 Community Testing Invitation

## rudder2snipe - Asset Sync for Rudder.io & Snipe-IT

**rudder2snipe** is a Python tool forked and adapted from the excellent [jamf2snipe](https://github.com/grokability/jamf2snipe) project. While jamf2snipe synchronizes Apple device data from Jamf Pro to Snipe-IT, **rudder2snipe** brings the same powerful synchronization capabilities to [Rudder.io](https://rudder.io) configuration management environments.

## 🤝 Help Us Test & Improve

- Large deployments (1000+ assets)
- Mixed OS environments (Linux, Windows, etc.)
- Different Rudder configurations
- Various Snipe-IT setups

**Types of Testing:**
- ✅ Installation and setup process
- ✅ Configuration file validation
- ✅ API connectivity and authentication
- ✅ Asset creation and field mapping
- ✅ User assignment workflows
- ✅ Performance with large datasets
- ✅ Error handling and edge cases
